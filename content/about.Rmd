This is my private blog, in which I post about wild things in R and econometrics. I have a background in economics and work as a data scientist in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany. 

## Projects 

I have contributed to these R packages: 


+ [fwildclusterboot](https://github.com/s3alfisc/fwildclusterboot)
 implements the fast wild cluster bootstrap algorithm for OLS from Roodman et al (2019) in R. [![CRAN status](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/fwildclusterboot)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fwildclusterboot) ![runiverse-package](https://s3alfisc.r-universe.dev/badges/fwildclusterboot) `r badger::badge_cran_download("fwildclusterboot", "grand-total", "blue")` `r badger::badge_cran_download("fwildclusterboot", "last-month", "green")`

+ [wildboottestjlr](https://github.com/s3alfisc/wildboottestjlr) is an R port of [WildBootTests.jl](https://github.com/droodman/WildBootTests.jl), which implements the fast wild cluster bootstrap for OLS/IV in Julia.
