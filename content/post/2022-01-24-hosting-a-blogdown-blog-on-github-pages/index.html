<p>I have recently moved from building this blog via the <a href="">distill</a> package to <a href="">blogdown</a>. The main reason for this is that, at the time of writing, distill does not support <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/distill/issues/33">full RSS feeds for multiple articles</a>. Deploying the <code>distill</code> based blog via github pages was quite straightforward, but doing so for the <code>blogdown</code> based blog proved to be quite cumbersome.</p>
<p>While there are many good blog posts on deploying blogdown-blogs on github pages, many users tend to run into problems, as this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45362628/github-pages-site-not-detecting-index-html">stackoverflow thread</a> with 100+ upvotes shows.</p>
<p>In my case, I needed to do two things for successful deployment of this blog on github pages:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>add a <code>.nojekyll</code> file to the main directory of the blog</li>
<li>add a <code>publishDir: docs</code> statement below <code>baseurl</code> in the <code>config.yaml</code> file. Rebuilding via <code>blogdown::build_site()</code> then creates a docs folder and populates it with html. On github pages, I then needed to make sure that the blog is build based on this docs folder (see the image below). After that, I simply had to commit, push, and github actions would finally deploy the blog without any error messages!</li>
</ol>
