<p>I have recently moved from building this blog via the <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/distill">distill</a> package to <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown">blogdown</a>. The main reason for this is that, at the time of writing, distill does not support <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/distill/issues/33">full RSS feeds for multiple articles</a>, which is a requirement for linking my blog to <a href="r-bloggers.com">R-bloggers</a>. Deploying the <code>distill</code> based blog via github pages was quite straightforward, but doing so for the <code>blogdown</code> based blog proved to be slightly more cumbersome.</p>
<p>While there are many good blog posts on deploying blogdown-blogs on github pages (e.g. <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/2019/09/start-blogging-in-5-minutes-on-netlify-with-hugo-and-blogdown-september-2019-update/">here</a> or <a href="https://www.caitlincasar.com/post/blogdown/">here</a>), I appear not to be the only one who ran into problems, as this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45362628/github-pages-site-not-detecting-index-html">stackoverflow thread</a> with 100+ upvotes shows.</p>
<p>In my case, I needed to do two things for successful deployment on github pages:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Add a <code>.nojekyll</code> file to the main directory of the blog, e.g. by running <code>file.create(".nojekyll")</code> in the r console</li>
<li>Add a <code>publishDir: docs</code> statement below <code>baseurl</code> in the <code>config.yaml</code> file. Rebuilding via <code>blogdown::build_site()</code> then creates a docs folder and populates it with html. On github pages, I then needed to make sure that the blog is build based on this docs folder (see the image below). After that, I simply had to commit, push, and github actions would finally deploy the blog without any error messages!</li>
</ol>
