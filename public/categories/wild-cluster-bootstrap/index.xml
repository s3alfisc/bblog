      <description>When you suspect that the error terms in your regression model are correlated within clusters, and the number of clusters is small, trouble might be running at you. In such a situation, common cluster robust standard errors tend to be downward biased - they are too eager to reject the null hypothesis. Since Cameron, Gelbach &amp;amp; Miller first suggested that the wild cluster bootstrap might be preferable to sandwich standard errors when the number of clusters is small, it has become common practice among empirical economists to check their cluster robust inferences against the wild cluster bootstrap.</description>
